# TEAM-PORTFOLIO-WEBSTIE---SE

  A collaborative static website showcasing our team members’ profiles, built using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages as part of our Software Engineering course (team 4 group 6, 3rd Year  ENSIA).

  The goal was to simulate real-world teamwork using **feature branching**, **pull requests**, **code reviews**, and **GitHub Pages deployment**.

# Team Retrospective Analysis 

## Technical Challenge:

Our most significant technical challenge was managing Git version control and merge conflicts as multiple members worked on the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files simultaneously. Early in the project, inconsistent branch naming and direct pushes to the main branch caused overwritten changes. To overcome this, we established a branching strategy that structured workflow reduced conflicts and improved collaboration efficiency.

- Merge Conflict Example:

A merge conflict occurred when integrating the updated  pages : one member had modified the section layout, while another had changed the same section’s color scheme. When we attempted to merge via pull request, GitHub flagged the conflict . We used VS Code’s “Compare Changes” tool to inspect differences, manually kept both layout improvements and the new styles, tested them locally, and then committed the resolved file. Finally, the branch was merged successfully.

## Evaluation of Pull Request and Peer Review Process:

The pull request and peer review process significantly improved our project’s quality. It allowed team members to review each other’s code, detect syntax or design inconsistencies, and discuss improvements before merging. This practice not only reduced bugs but also encouraged collaborative learning, as each review served as feedback for better coding practices. Overall, this workflow enhanced both the technical quality and team communication throughout the project.
