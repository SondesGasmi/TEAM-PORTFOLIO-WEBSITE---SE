# TEAM-PORTFOLIO-WEBSTIE---SE

  A collaborative static website showcasing our team membersâ€™ profiles, built using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages as part of our Software Engineering course (team 4 group 6, 3rd Year  ENSIA).

  The goal was to simulate real-world teamwork using **feature branching**, **pull requests**, **code reviews**, and **GitHub Pages deployment**.
